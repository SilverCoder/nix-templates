# Nix Flake Templates

Welcome to the Nix Flake Templates repository! This collection of Nix flake templates is designed to make your Nix-based project setup a breeze. Whether you're just starting or you're a seasoned Nix user, these templates are here to help you kickstart your project with ease.

## Getting Started

To use these templates, follow these simple steps:

1. Initialize a new Nix flake project using the template of your choice. Replace `TEMPLATE` with the name of the template you want to use.

```bash
nix flake init --template github:SilverCoder/nix-templates#TEMPLATE
```

For example, if you want to use the "bevy" template:

```bash
nix flake init --template github:SilverCoder/nix-templates#bevy
```

2. Once initialized, you'll find a project structure and Nix configuration files ready to use. These templates serve as starting points, and you can modify them to fit your specific needs.

3. Customize your project by adding extra packages, adjusting configurations, or making any other changes to suit your requirements.
